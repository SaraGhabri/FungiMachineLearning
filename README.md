# 🍄 Fungal Leaf Disease Detection – Streamlit App

This app allows users to detect fungal diseases in plant leaves by uploading images. It uses a MobileNetV2 deep learning model fine-tuned on a fungal leaf dataset.

## 👨‍🔬 Model

We used MobileNetV2 for its speed and efficiency. It's trained to recognize:

- Apple Scab
- Apple Black Rot
- Grape Black Rot
- Cedar Rust
- Healthy leaves

## 🚀 Usage
